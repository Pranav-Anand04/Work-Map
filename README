# Workout out Project created by Pranav Anand on January 11 2024
# This project was created using leaflet libraries.

#### Description 

This project allows you to choose what workout you have done at that day and then adds a location to the map.
This allows users to workout somewhere new everyday while making there body healthier. This will help them gain
motivation everday to change there lives. 
This projects requires the users location to create a map at that latitude and longtitude, where then user can
what exact location they want. After they pick the website will show them the input form, where they will be 
required to log in what type of workout, distance, duration, and calories they have lost. These three are 
main factors that are needed in every workout. Then after the button is clicked it creates a new form and 
each form will have different ID's. If user wants to delete a workout they will be promted and they have to 
enter the ID of which form they want to delete. To delete the marker they will have to double tab the marker.

Thank you.
